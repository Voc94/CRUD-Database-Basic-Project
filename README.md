# 2nd Year CRUD Database Project
Very basic and well.. crude way of implementing a Database Relation with a Java Interface using Java Swing, it has a pretty bad grasp on design patterns and it's kinda smelly code.
##Functionalities
-Crud operations on objects
-Record for storing events
-Abstract DAO class for products
-Connection to SQL database
